# MusicPlayer2

The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.

Why this project?
In the last portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to think about the structure of an app and how to use OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities within your own app. You also learned how to loop through an ArrayList to retrieve and display information to a ListView. Practicing these skills will drastically improve the quality of the apps you build down the road.

What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
Creating new activities
Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app
Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
Creating your own Custom Class
Looping through an ArrayList
Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
